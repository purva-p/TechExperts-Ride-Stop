        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p1>The reach of electronics and technology is very wide, and it can reach multiple people in one go
            through the internet and devices like laptops, PCs, mobile phones. Scholarships are available in
            chosen fields of study in different countries. To attract international students and to widen the
            scope of study among the poor and downtrodden and also give quality education to students
            who cannot avail that in their own countries. It is necessary to have a website to explain to
            students what is available, where and at what cost.</p1>
            

        <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
        <P>In the Indian Education System students have to prepare for 'n' number of exams throughout
            their life and there are various scholarships available at different stages of oneâ€™s career. All the
            information and data regarding these exams and scholarships are not easily accessible on the
            internet. So, a website with all the details about exams and scholarships of different career
            paths together in a well organized manner will be helpful to all the students. So, the purpose of
            this project will be to provide data related to all the exams and scholarships on a single platform
            which will be easily access.</P>
